<P> One of the most powerful tools of today's world is YouTube. (https://www.youtube.com/) I have been using YouTube for many years, and it has always been evolving. I'm inspired by the clean interface Youtube has. Youtube also is pretty easy to use. It is easy enough to where someone can just hop on the computer with little to no knowledge and search up anything they want. Youtube holds a lot of information and is now the virtual teacher and entertainer for babies, kids, adults, grandparents, and even pets. YouTube was not always like how it is now. I want my website to be always changing and improving just like YouTube. <P>
